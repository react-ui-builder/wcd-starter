### The library contains a set of components based on the [name of the base library].

**Current version of the library: `1.0.0`.**

Choose the appropriate boilerplate for your new project and download it to your local disk. Follow the instructions for setting up the project which is inside the boilerplate.

Each boilerplate contains a copy of the component library you are currently seeing in React UI Builder.

### List of available boilerplates:

* [boileplate github link]
* [boileplate github link]

### Working in React UI Builder:

#### Try a component in isolation
In the left panel in `Component` section you will find a tree of available components in this library.
Clicking on a component name will open a new tab where you can try how the component works. You can also find documentation on the component and its properties there.

#### Combine components

Create pages on which you can combine components by drag and drop. Combinations of components on the page can serve as the backbone of your new component, the code of which you can save to the local disk in the project that was created with a boilerplate.

#### Reuse some combinations as templates

You have the option to reuse combinations of components on other pages - just save as template. Each template acts like a single component and can be dragged to any desired location on the page in edit mode.

#### Reuse component instances

Each component being placed on the page becomes an instance of a component with its own unique name. Different instances of a component may have different property values. To make sure that two instances located in different places on a page or on different pages have the same property values, give them the same name.

### Contribution

If you see a bug in a component, or if you want to add a new component to the library, we would be happy if you create a new PR for this library in GitHub repo: [link to github repo].
